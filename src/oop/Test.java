Itâ€™s a basic concept. Whenever u create the object of a child, the definition of the child will come into play.
What I want to do is, reference variable belongs to the parent.
And the object belongs to the child. This is known as Polymorphic statement.
How it is a polymorphic statement?
The Shape s is point to Circle.
Shape is now behaving as circle.
